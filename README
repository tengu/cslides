* cslides: a minimal, unixy slideshow viewer.
  * feed image path stream to stdin and it will display each image for a second.
  * usage:  find . -name '*.jpg' | cslides [delay-in-seconds]

* Why would I want to use this? 
  * You probably don't; it is probably too barebone for most people.
  * It is for unix shell environment.
  * More of a hello-world of imlib2 and X programming.
  * Hopefully it will be a starting poit for usable slideshow viewer.

* dependencies: Xlib, imlib2 
  * debian: sudo dpkg -i libimlib2-dev
  * freebsd: cd /usr/ports/graphics/imlib2; sudo make install
